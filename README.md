# Evolution-Simulation
This project is an implementation of a simple neural network in Rust. It includes basic functionalities such as creating a network with random layers and propagating inputs through the network.

## Structs
   - ````Network````: Represents the neural network. It contains a vector of ````Layer```` objects.
   - ````Layer````: Represents a layer in the neural network. Each layer contains a vector of ````Neuron```` objects.
   - ````Neuron````: Represents a single neuron in a layer. It has a bias and a set of weights.

For the beggining of this project I followed the tutorial by  [patryk27](https://pwy.io/posts/learning-to-fly-pt1/). I intend to add other features to the neural network this is just a jumping off point and my first project in rust.
